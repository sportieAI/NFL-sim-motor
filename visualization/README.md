# Visualization Directory

This directory contains scripts and utilities for visualizing state transitions, simulation results, and debugging outputs.

## Intended Use

- **State Transition Visualization:** Plot how the simulation state evolves step-by-step.
- **Debugging:** Help developers identify unexpected state changes or anomalies.
- **Model Improvement:** Provide visual insights into decision points and agent behavior.

## Typical Contents

- Visualization scripts (e.g., `state_transition_viz.py`)
- Utilities for reading simulation logs and generating plots
- Output images or interactive dashboards

**How to Use:**  
Run visualization scripts on log files produced during simulation runs to create plots or interactive visual summaries.
