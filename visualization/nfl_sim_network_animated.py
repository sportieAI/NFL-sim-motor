# nfl_sim_network_animated.py

"""
This script implements an animated, tag-colored NFL simulation network visualization.

Features:
- Animates the network by possession or time window.
- Colors edges by momentum tag (limegreen=positive, crimson=negative, blue=neutral).
- Supports subgraph extraction (QB-only, pass-only, or tag-filtered visualizations).
- Interactive Plotly output with edge hover details (tags, outcome, yardage, timestamp).
- Modular grouping and filtering for deep simulation analytics and strategic benchmarking.

This tool enables dynamic, semantic, and strategic visual exploration of NFL event logs.
